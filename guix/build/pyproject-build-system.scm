;;; Commentary:
;;;
;;; PEP 517-compatible build system for Python packages.
;;;
;;; PEP 517 mandates the use of a TOML file called pyproject.toml at the
;;; project root, describing build and runtime dependencies, as well as the
;;; build system, which can be different from setuptools. This module uses
;;; that file to extract the build system used and call its wheel-building
;;; entry point build_wheel (see 'build). setuptools’ wheel builder is
;;; used as a fallback if either no pyproject.toml exists or it does not
;;; declare a build-system. It supports config_settings through the
;;; standard #:configure-flags argument.
;;;
;;; This wheel, which is just a ZIP file with a file structure defined
;;; by PEP 427 (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0427/), is then unpacked
;;; and its contents are moved to the appropriate locations in 'install.
;;;
;;; Then entry points, as defined by the PyPa Entry Point Specification
;;; (https://packaging.python.org/specifications/entry-points/) are read
;;; from a file called entry_points.txt in the package’s site-packages
;;; subdirectory and scripts are written to bin/. These are not part of a
;;; wheel and expected to be created by the installing utility.
;;; TODO: Add support for PEP-621 entry points.
;;;
;;; This module also supports in-tree build backends, which can be
;;; overridden by #:backend-path.
;;;
;;; Code:
;;;

;; Re-export these variables from python-build-system as many packages
;; rely on these.
