  ;; hard-coding the specifics of how npm's internal copy of node-gyp is
  ;; currently packaged. However, the mechanism by which the automatic support
  ;; is implemented causes problems for us.
  ;;
  ;; If a package contains a 'binding.gyp' file and does not define an
  ;; 'install' or 'preinstall' script, 'npm install' runs a default install
  ;; script consisting of 'node-gyp rebuild'. In our 'install' phase, this
  ;; implicit 'install' script, if it is applicable, is explicitly added to
  ;; the "package.json" file. However, if another Guix package were to use a
  ;; Node.js package with such an 'install' script, the dependent package's
  ;; build process would fail, because 'node-gyp rebuild' would try to write
  ;; to the store.
  ;;
  ;; Here, if the installed "package.json" defines scripts.install as
  ;; "node-gyp rebuild", we replace it with a no-op. Importantly, deleting the
  ;; install script definition would not be enough, because the default
  ;; install script would cause the same problem.
